      <li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
      <li>1 3/4 pounds ground pork</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Steps for dish OL-->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy
        sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten
        edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll
        edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly
        floured surface until ready to cook.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't
        touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam for 15 minutes, or
        until pork is cooked through.
      </li>
      <br />
    </ol>
